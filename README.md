# emc-rf-calculator
This is a personnal project which aims to help me work faster in electromagnetic compatibility job.<br>
This is the first time i'll make a program that tries to be professional. So if you're passing by this repo<br>
do not hesitate to give feedback !

### It should contain:
  - Linear / Logarithm conversions
  - Plotting limit
  - Extrapolate values from Linear And / Or Logarithm values for custom customers limit
  - More to be added later

### In this endeavor:
  - I'll make a responsive UI
  - I'll make cool signals associated with custom callback for pleasing UI experience
  - I'll start by making the app english only at first but later i'll add at least english language
  - All the logic will be handle in Rust while the UI will be using .slint files (Slint declarative language)
  
  
## This project is the occasion for me to actively and seriously learn Rust associated with Slint UI framework. Except a long time of development as I do this on spare time, which I don't have a lot.

  PS: The Readme will be updated along the advancement of my project
